Did two of them at least.

9.14

```{r}
atoa <- c(88.3,40.7,36.3,27.3,36.8,91.7,67.3,7,45.2,23.3,98.8,90.1,17.2,23.7,97.4,32.4,87.8,69.8,62.6,99.7,20.6,73.1,21.6,6,45.3,76.6,73.2,27.3,87.6,87.2)
d1 <- max((1:length((atoa/100))) / length((atoa/100)) - (atoa/100))
d2 <- max((atoa/100) - ((1:length(atoa/100)) - 1) / length(atoa/100))
d1;d2
```

The larger of the above is correct. In either case, the number is larger than the critical value, so we can reject that the accidents are uniformally distributed.

10.1

a.

null: mu = 22.5 jobs

alt: mu != 22.5 jobs

```{r}
times <- c(18.9,22,19.4,22.1,19.8,21.9,20.2)
mu <- 22.5
t2 <- t.test(times, mu = mu)
t2[1]$statistic
```

A negative here means we can do this...

```{r}
qt(.025,length(times)-1)
```

Yay we can reject the null.
