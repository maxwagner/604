My other classes put off due dates an extra week due to break, I assumed the same. Didn't mean it to be late.

##1a.

In this case, there is one source, 5 servers (a single clerk getting the driving history, two clerks each giving a written exam in parallel, and two checkout computers in parallel), and 1 sink.

##1b.

Source:

Interval arrival time set to 6 minutes

![](http://puu.sh/oxetg/9c842a7ec7.png)

Path Source -> History:

![](http://puu.sh/oxeBG/1711202a4e.png)

History:

A process time of 5, and a outemp2ound rule to link weight, so there is a 50/50 chance of where they go.

Path History -> ExamClerk:

ExamClerk 1/2:

Set process time to 8.8 minutes

![](http://puu.sh/oxf2i/af70d10aee.png)

Path ExamClerk -> Node:

![](http://puu.sh/oxfcr/6ebb55e6c9.png)

Node:

Again set by link weight

Path Node -> Checkout 1/2:

![](http://puu.sh/oxfiu/3c794eeae7.png)

Checkout 1/2:

Process time of 9 minutes

![](http://puu.sh/oxfm2/79c3983bf6.png)

Path Checkout 1/2 to Sink:

Sink:

##1c.

Some average run times from the system.

##1d.

It gets rid of one of the human clerks, and adds in two new kiosks in parallel. The paths can be set to be equal lengths even though they aren't the same in the picute.

##2.

Let's do it in R first.

```{r}
mm1 <- function (){
dura   <- 1220 # duration of sim
start <- 0 # start time
inter <- 10 # interarrival time
serv <- 7 # service time
next.a <- 0 # next arrival
next.d <- dura # next departure
temp1 <- start # temps
temp2 <- 0
n <- 0
s <- 0
b <- 0
c <- 0


# run while clock hasn't reached completion
  while (start < dura) {
    if (next.a < next.d) { # arriving   
      start <- next.a
      s <- s + n * (start - temp1)
      n <- n + 1
      temp1 <- start
      next.a <- start + rexp(1, 1/inter)
      if(n == 1) { 
        temp2 <- start
        next.d <- start + rexp(1, 1/serv)
      }
    } else { # leaving         
      start <- next.d
      s <- s + n * (start - temp1)
      n <- n - 1
      temp1 <- start
      c <- c + 1
      if (n > 0) { 
        next.d <- start + rexp(1, 1/serv)
      } else { 
        next.d <- dura
        b <- b + start - temp2
      }
    } 
  }
return(c(b,c))
}

queue <- replicate(1000, mm1())
paste('Utilization Rate:', mean(queue[1,] / 1220)) 
paste('System Time:' , mean(queue[1,]/ mean(queue[2,] )), 'minutes')
```

And the Simio version:

##6.1

arrival times = every 4 minutes

service time = every 3 minutes

atten pay = 10/hour

mech pay = 15/hour

With one attendant, lets find number of mechanics and then cost to run it:

$$ \frac{1/4}{(1/3) - (1/4)} = 3 $$

$$ 15(3) + 10 = 55 dollars $$

With two attendants, we can use a MMc queue. I'll leave out some of the equations but it comes out to a cost of roughly 33 dollars instead of the above 55. This is due to there being less mechanics in use at any given time.

##6.2

We can use a MM1 queue in this case and come out with the equation:

$$ 3 \leq \frac{lambda}{(2/3)(2/3 - lambda)} $$

Solving this gives $lambda = 4/9$ and $lambda = 2/3$. From that, we can assume that rates lower than $lambda = 2/3$ will satisfy the problem.
